i love my mom but i cant express my feeling to her or to anyone, i just thought that i feel cringe and i disgusted myself for it. It just like there is a demon inside of me and that demon has emotion too but try to bottom up. I want to say i love her so much and also my dad, i think there is nothing more suffering or miserable than being lonely and your kids dont share compassion to you. I want to say that i love her and iam sorry for the mood swing for the past long while. I hope someday i can do it, that i say i love her and care for her
